# NIBoardGamery

This is a site that I created for a board game cafe that I used to work for.
I started from a template and added the information and media for the Boardgamery and tweaked it and adjusted it until I thought it looked like good!
This was my first time ever working from a template, so a lot of the challenge was learning about the pre-existing code that I wasn't familiar with and experimenting with how to manipulate it to behave how I wanted it to.
